## Lecture 1: Course Overview + The Shell

**Summary:**

- Introduction to the course.
- Importance of mastering tools.
- Basics of the Unix shell and command-line interface.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Shell commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`.
- Redirection and piping: `>`, `<`, `|`.
- Command substitution: `` `command` ``.

## Lecture 2: Shell Tools and Scripting

**Summary:**

- Advanced shell tools.
- Scripting basics to automate tasks.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Text processing: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`.
- File manipulation: `find`, `xargs`.
- Scripting with bash: shebang (`#!/bin/bash`), variables, loops, conditionals.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Processing $file"
  grep "pattern" "$file"
done
```

## Lecture 3: Editors (Vim)

**Summary:**

- Efficient text editing with Vim.
- Customizing Vim to suit your workflow.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Vim modes: normal, insert, visual.
- Basic commands: `:w`, `:q`, `:x`, `:e`.
- Customization: `.vimrc`, plugins.

## Lecture 4: Data Wrangling

**Summary:**

- Manipulating and analyzing data from the command line.
- Combining tools to handle complex tasks.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Data transformation: `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`.
- Combining commands: `paste`, `join`.
- Example pipeline to process CSV data.

```bash
cut -d, -f1,3 data.csv | sort | uniq > result.csv
```

## Lecture 5: Command-line Environment

**Summary:**

- Customizing and optimizing your command-line environment.
- Efficient use of terminal multiplexers.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Customizing shell prompt: `PS1`.
- Using `tmux` for terminal multiplexing.
- Configuration files: `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`.

## Lecture 6: Version Control (Git)

**Summary:**

- Basics and advanced features of Git.
- Collaboration workflows using Git.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Basic commands: `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`.
- Branching and merging: `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`.
- Collaboration: `git fork`, `git pull request`.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin master
```

## Lecture 7: Debugging and Profiling

**Summary:**

- Techniques for debugging and profiling code.
- Tools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Debugging tools: `gdb`, `pdb` for Python.
- Profiling tools: `gprof`, `perf`, `valgrind`.
- Example of using `gdb` to debug a C program.

```c
gdb ./a.out
(gdb) run
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) quit
```

## Lecture 8: Metaprogramming

**Summary:**

- Writing programs that write programs.
- Using metaprogramming for code generation and automation.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Macros in C: `#define`.
- Code generation tools: `m4`, `autoconf`.
- Example of using macros in C.

```c
#define MAX(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
```

## Lecture 9: Security and Cryptography

**Summary:**

- Basics of security and cryptography.
- Common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**

- Encryption tools: `gpg`, `openssl`.
- Common vulnerabilities: buffer overflows, SQL injection.
- Example of using `openssl` to encrypt a file.

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.txt.enc
```

## Lecture 10: Potpourri

**Summary:**

- Miscellaneous useful tools and techniques.
- Tips and tricks to improve productivity.

**Key Concepts and Codes:**
